# my-react-pokedex
A react app practice with the use of pokeApi and fetch. It serves Pokemon Cards with various info.

This would have been more eaaser to make if I had used sass and bootstrap. So I'm leaning that now.

Just a simple poke-api app that lets you search avery pokemon in the api.

You can search by:

  - pokedex
  - type
  - evolutions

You can adjust the amount of pokemon shown in options

Overall I took way too much time in this. But it was pretty fun to make. 

Now, I'm gonna check other poke apps and see what i could have added and/or done better
